    "Hello from the other side! Yes I am an Adele fan. I also am a fan of cakes and animals, dogs and cats specifically! The 2020 pandemic forced the world to shut down and its citizen were shut in. This introduced a surge of trends born out of creativity in various fields. As an amature baker, the trend that caught my eye was the art of making shockingly realistic cakes. Now if I look at am image online, its hard to figure out if what I'm looking at is a cake or an actual animal! \n",
    "\n",
    "To shoo the confusion away, I designed a deep learning FastAI image classification model that will tell me if the image I am looking at is something to eat or to pet (cautiously since some of them might be wild animals!) The idea for this app was the FastAI lectures by [Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2). The process of creating the model is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MarissaFernandes22/Cake_animal_classifier)"
